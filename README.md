# tic-tac-toe--between-robot-and-human2
This report describes a simple project where a Dobot Magician Lite robot plays Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player. The robot uses a camera to observe the player’s moves and a basic AI logic to decide its own responses. Each move is made by picking up and placing small colored cubes with a suction cup attached to the robot’s arm. By combining computer vision and decision-making algorithms, the system demonstrates how human–robot interaction can be achieved in a practical and engaging way. The project also provides a hands-on learning experience that connects robotics, artificial intelligence, and automation concepts in an educational setup.
